## Project Description
We are going to simulate a multi-degree-of-freedom robotic arm that recognizes an object to grab and place it. The robot will identify a cube on a table (representing a box of cookies), identify a ball (representing an apple), and identify a cylinder (representing a cup of water). Then put them in the designated locations. While grabbing the items, the tongs need to apply proper force to hold the item firm but wonâ€™t squeeze it broken. Our robot should also avoid obstacles when picking and placing objects, it should use a proper angle and speed to reduce the impulse. For example, the cup should always stay stable when it is grabbed or placed (the cup is always vertical). 
We tentatively select this topic for project, tentatively use Gazebo for simulation, and the robot used for simulation is undetermined.
